We will expand github’s existing functionality to create a core hub that creates communication between the business owner and developers which can increase productivity and minimize problems by providing the ability to track a more granular status, due date and priority. We’ll also provide a seamless environment to facilitate communication between developers and the customer to take in issues and have the internal team have the ability to take those tickets directly to github.
